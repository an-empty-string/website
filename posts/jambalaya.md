This is how I make jambalaya. It is probably pretty unsurprising. Makes about 4 servings (or 3 if folks are hungry).

## Ingredients

* **Equipment**: A big pot with a lid (I use a Dutch oven).
* **Olive oil**, 3tbsp or enough for frying stuff
* **Cajun seasoning**, 1tbsp (storebought is fine, or use 1 part thyme, 2 parts black pepper, 2 parts onion powder, 2 parts oregano, 2 parts cayenne pepper, 4 parts garlic powder, 4 parts salt, and 6 parts paprika)
* **Chicken breast**, 3/4lb or so (1 breast)
* **Andouille sausage**, 1/2lb or so
* **Bell peppers**, 2 (I use 1 red and 1 yellow)
* **Yellow onion**, 1/2 of a large onion
* **Jalapeno pepper**, 1/3rd of a pepper (more if you like)
* **Garlic**, 2 cloves or a few spoonfuls of the pre-minced stuff
* **Celery**, 1 stalk
* **Diced or crushed tomatoes**, 7oz (half a can)
* **Chicken stock**, 2 cups
* **Basmati rice**, 1 cup (any other long-grain white rice is fine)

## Steps

* Dice the bell peppers, jalapeno pepper, onion, and celery stalk (you can combine these now) and set aside. Mince the garlic and set aside.
* Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and set aside.
* Cut the sausage into small rounds and cook it in some olive oil on medium heat until a little brown. Set aside, but do not discard the fat.
* Cook the chicken in the sausage fat until a little brown on all sides. Add a little more olive oil if you need to. Set aside.
* Add a little more oil and fry the peppers/onions in the pan until the onion starts smelling sweet. Add the minced garlic.
* Add the tomatoes (drained if you're using diced tomatoes), chicken stock, rice, and Cajun seasoning. Stir it all together.
* Bring to a boil on high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer covered for about 15 minutes (until most of the liquid is absorbed).
* Add the sausage and chicken back to the pot, mix together, and cook until done (another 5-10 minutes).
