Microsoft publishes a list of Office 365 SKUs, their associated GUIDs, and internal names at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-service-plan-reference â€“ this can be very useful for writing applications that integrate with a reseller or the Azure AD licensing APIs.
