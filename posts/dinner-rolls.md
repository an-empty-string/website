Here is a recipe for dinner rolls. Note that it is very easy to accidentally kill the yeast here &mdash; the temperature ranges are pretty important. Also, if you have a stand mixer, it is not worth using for this recipe; hand mixing is somehow less effort (I have tried).

Makes 12 rolls.

## Ingredients

* **Equipment**: A 9ish-inch circular baking dish (pie pan or so). A small saucepan. A cooking thermometer. Mixing bowls. A wire cooling rack.
* **All-purpose flour**, 2 cups. Probably best to not use bread flour.
* **Unsalted butter**, 2tbsp. Or use a little less salt later.
* **Granulated white sugar**, 2tbsp.
* **Honey**, 1tbsp.
* **Salt**, 1/2tsp.
* **Whole milk**, 1/2 cup.
* **Water**, 1/4 cup.
* **Yeast**, 1 packet or 2 1/4tsp. I use active dry yeast, instant is probably OK.

## Steps

* Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
* Add the water and milk to the saucepan. Heat for a few minutes to about 110 degrees.
* Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl with the honey, stir until mixed. Let cool to 100-110 degrees (very important!!!).
* Add the yeast to the liquid and stir, proof.
* Mix together the flour, sugar, and salt in another bowl. Then add to the yeast mixture and mix.
* Keep adding flour and mixing, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough is workable by hand.
* Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 10-12 minutes (until smooth), adding flour as necessary.
* Let the dough rest for about 20 minutes, then break into 12 parts. Shape each part into a sphere and place onto a greased baking dish.
* Let rise for about an hour; the rolls should be crowding each other.
* Bake at 375 degrees for about 17 minutes, or until the top of the rolls are golden brown (the sides will be lighter)
* Cool on a wire cooling rack (if you have one) for a few minutes; serve warm.
