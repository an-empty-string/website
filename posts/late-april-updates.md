Happy Easter y'all! (if you celebrate)

This isn't a normal Post, I just have a lot of things happening and wanted to share some of them.

## Here's what's new

I made a lovely Good Friday dinner for some friends and partners, and found some really tasty vegetarian recipes in the process. I made:

* [This vegetarian tortilla soup](https://cookieandkate.com/vegetarian-tortilla-soup/), which uses black beans instead of chicken. It turned out great with no substitutions! If you want, you can fry the tortilla strips to a light golden brown in a pan instead of baking them (this lets you add more spices too!).
* [This lentil bolognese](https://rainbowplantlife.com/10-ingredient-vegan-red-lentil-bolognese/) which can be made nut-free by substituting mushrooms for walnuts (there's a note in the recipe about this; it works great but I found the leftovers don't keep quite as well because the mushrooms get kinda squishy).

These two are now on the recipes section of the [bookmarks list](/bookmarks.html).

### Rosemary bread recipe

I also made rosemary bread, based loosely on [this recipe](https://www.kitchensanctuary.com/artisan-bread-recipe/), some ratios I found somewhere else, and some experience with dutch oven baking. Here is how to make it:

/// details | *Expand recipe*
* Mix some freshly chopped rosemary (~2 sprigs) with extra virgin olive oil (1 or 2 tbsp)
* Take 4 cups (500 grams) bread flour and mix with 1.5tsp salt.
* Proof 1.5tsp yeast with a little brown sugar (1tsp is fine) in 1.5 cup warm water (100-110 degrees F).
* Mix it all together and knead for about 10 minutes. If you have a stand mixer, use that. If the dough is sticky to the touch after about the first 5 minutes, add a little more flour.
* Prepare a bowl with cooking spray, put the dough in it, and let rise for 3 or 4 hours.

About 30 minutes before the bread is done rising, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Put a dutch oven in and preheat that too.

After rising:

* Don't punch down the dough (no need to remove all the air, although this process will get most of it out); instead use a spatula to gently scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl, folding the dough in on itself.
* Dump the dough onto a lightly floured sheet of parchment.
* Carefully shape the dough on the parchment. You can score it if you want, but I didn't.
* VERY carefully put the parchment and dough into the preheated dutch oven. Bake covered.

After 20-30 minutes of baking:

* Mix some more freshly chopped rosemary and olive oil.
* Brush the mixture onto the bread.
* Continue to bake uncovered for 10-15 minutes, checking every 5 minutes or so and brushing more rosemary/oil mixture onto the bread as needed.

After you are done, the bread should be a light golden brown.

## What else I've been up to

### Places

The tower at [Mount Auburn Cemetery](https://www.mountauburn.org/) is open for the season again, and the flowers are back in bloom! It is gorgeous there. If you haven't been, you should check it out.

### Reading

I read Becky Chambers' [A Psalm for the Wild-Built](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1240266570) (WorldCat link), a novella about rest (and a beautiful vision of a possible future, but mostly rest). You should check it out. It is a pretty short read.

Other long-form fiction I enjoyed lately: <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1477785443">The Transitive Properties of Cheese</a>; <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1182846103">She Who Became the Sun</a> (WorldCat links). Thanks Philo and Faely for the recommendations. Both are very trans stories.

If you haven't already read [Philo's "I Helped A Stranger Fare Evade On The MBTA And Now There's An Elven Mage On My Couch"](https://philo.gay/stories/isekai.html), you should check that out too. It's very cute.

### Coming back to faith

You already know this if you talk to me regularly, but over the past few months I have turned into an Episcopalian (a type of mainline Protestant Christian). This was honestly a pretty unexpected turn for me!

I am going to write a more in-depth blog post about that, but in the meantime, I am happy to talk about it, if you're wondering what's up.

### Current events

/// details | *content warnings for US politics, gun violence, my mental health*

Things are pretty scary over here!

I've been paying pretty close attention to the [Abrego Garcia](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/abrego-garcia-v-noem/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc) and [Ozturk](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69845539/ozturk-v-hyde/?order_by=desc) cases. It's kind of frustrating to see media outlets try to both-sides this stuff; the primary source documents are pretty damning for the government. I have a little bit of hope that things will resolve themselves (Abrego Garcia ending up in a non-CECOT facility feels pretty significant, and Ozturk's case is progressing well I think, just very slowly) but if not, we are all in for a pretty bad time, I suspect.

On Sunday, [someone fired shots inside Harvard Station](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/4/21/mbta-harvard-square-shelter-in-place/) on the lower platform. I had just got off a train from the upper platform. I am physically fine but this stuff leaves more of a mental scar than I realized. I am looking forward to being able to take a Red Line train through/from/to Harvard again without having to talk myself down from a panic reaction :grimace:

## Upcoming plans

Not much that I can talk about! I'm moving (within greater Boston) soon and the housing market sucks, so that should be interesting to navigate.

I might try to make a sporadic habit of writing posts like this in the future. If you have feedback please tell me what you think (on Signal or via email, tris@tris.fyi).
